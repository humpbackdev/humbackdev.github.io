      <h1>What is Humpback?</h1>
      <p class="lead">Humpback is a Docker-based environment for Drupal development that makes it easy to build Drupal 8 sites allowing you to focus only in building your sites and not your environment. It has several tools useful for any developer involved in the process.</p>
      <p>It's composed of 2 projects <a href="https://github.com/humpbackdev/humpback">Humpback</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-humpback">Humpback Generator</a>. The former is the development environment and the latest is the generator to create projects using that development environment.</p>
      <h2>Why Humpback?</h2>
      <p>Docker is a whale, so, we wanted to be a whale too. While researching for whales, we loved the idea of naming our project as Humpback because that's one of the species most seen at Costa Rica</p>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>Humpback generator is extremely easy to use. Just install it from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-humpback">npm project page</a> and generate a project in a new folder:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <pre>
          <span class="code-line">npm install -g yo</span>
          <span class="code-line">npm install -g generator-humpback</span>
        </pre>
      </div>
      And then:
      <div class="code">
        <pre>
          <span class="code-line">mkdir my-project && cd my-project</span>
          <span class="code-line">yo humpback</span>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>In the generated project, you'll have the necessary documentation to continue your journey. You also can access that documentation in <a href="https://github.com/humpbackdev/generator-humpback/blob/HEAD/USAGE.md">USAGE.md</a></p>
